# Lokio's Mod for Agar.io
A sweet mod for Agar.io  
  
## Backend Files
**To reduce deployment time for new versions, this extension uses external files hosted on my webserver. Here's a list of them.**
* (http://terminalbit.com/agario/launcher.js)[launcher.js (Does some initializing)]
* (http://terminalbit.com/agario/lokiosmod.js)[lokiosmod.js (Replaces main_out.js)]
* (http://terminalbit.com/agario/skins)[Skin folder (Currently 404s)]
* And a few other images.

*I've gotta set up the __/skins__ folder to display as an index for easy browsing, but for now that's what we've got.*
