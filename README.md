# Lokio's Mod for Agar.io
A sweet mod for Agar.io  
  
## How it works
**We used to use my webserver for files, here's the locations**
* [launcher.js (Does some initializing)](http://terminalbit.com/agario/launcher.js)
* [lokiosmod.js (Replaces main_out.js)](http://terminalbit.com/agario/lokiosmod.js)
* [Skin folder (Currently 404s)](http://terminalbit.com/agario/skins)
* And a few other images.
 
*But now we're going to use RawGit since we forcibly upgrade agar.io requests to HTTPS to prevent blocking on big networks*
